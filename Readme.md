Attempts at drawing [Julia sets][Julia] efficiently with Python. I know that Python isn't the right tool for this job - I did it anyways. üòµ‚Äçüí´ Why? Mostly to improve my Python skills, by working my way through the second edition of [High Performance Python][HPP] which is using the Julia set imaging as an example. Arguably the most valuable insight I've gained by playing around with these experiments is how amazing the [PyPy][PyPy] performance can be.
